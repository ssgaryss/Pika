## Pika Engine
Welcome to Pika Engine! 🎉
Pika Engine 是个人独立开发的渲染引擎，旨在将我的所学付诸于实现。
现阶段的Pika Engine 已近具备初步的2D引擎特征，正在前往3D的开发之路...
# Getting Started
Visual Studio 2022 is recommended, Pika is officially untested on other development environments whilst I focus on a Windows build.
1. Downloading the repository:
   Start by cloning the repository with git clone --recursive https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel.
   If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use git submodule update --init to clone the necessary submodules.

2. Configuring the dependencies:
   Run the Windows-GenProject.bat file found in scripts folder. This will download the required prerequisites for the project if they are not present yet.
